--BASIC SQL QUERIES TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA (descriptive analysis)
--1) This shows the first 10 rows of the dataset and helps understand structure and fields of data
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_insurance
LIMIT 10;

--2) Look at how many specific regions we are looking at as part of the dataset use keyword DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT region
FROM healthcare_insurance;

--3) Avg, min and max
SELECT
AVG(charges) AS avg_charges,
MIN(charges) AS min_charges,
MAX(charges) AS max_charges -- no comma after last column in select statement
FROM healthcare_insruance; -- semi colon ends sql statement use commas in between within single query

--4) count male females
-- all of these queries do the same thing best one is third one
/*
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM healthcare_insurance
WHERE sex = "female";

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM healthcare_insurance
WHERE sex = "male"; */

SELECT sex, COUNT(*)
FROM healthcare_insurance
GROUP BY sex;

--SELECT DISTINCT sex
--FROM healthcare_insurance

--5) Gender distribution of charges
SELECT sex, AVG(charges) AS average_charges --selecting the sex and avg charges for output
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
GROUP BY sex; -- grouping by sex, so one column for male and one column for female

--BASIC SQL QUERIES for EDA (exploratory data analysis)
--6)Count of Smokers Versus Nonsmokers
SELECT smoker, COUNT(*) AS count -- selecting the value of smoker so we can see if its yes or no and the count 
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from our table
GROUP BY smoker; -- group by smoker means we want to group teh data BY the column smoker and return vals

--7)Impact of Smoking on Charges
SELECT smoker, AVG(charges) -- select the smoker and average charges
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
GROUP BY smoker; -- group by whether they are smoker or not (so a yes or no)

--8) Difference of Impact of Smoking on Charges
SELECT 
   AVG(CASE WHEN smoker = 'yes' THEN charges END) -- calculate average charges for smokers only
   - AVG(CASE WHEN smoker = 'no' THEN charges END) -- subtract average charges for non smokers
  AS avg_charge_difference -- set the name of the result as avg_charge_difference
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the insurance table

--9) Avg charges by age group
SELECT age, AVG(charges) AS avg_charge -- we are selecting the age column and the average charges for the output
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table of data
GROUP BY age -- we are grouping by age, because we want to separate the columns of table out by AGE
ORDER BY avg_charge; -- order by in ascending order (lowest to highest order is default so dont rlly need word ASC)

--10)top 5 people who tend to have the highest healthcare charges
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_insurance -- selecting from the table 
ORDER BY charges DESC -- we want to order it by the healthcare insurance charges from highest to lowest
LIMIT 5; -- we are only looking here at the first 5 rows (so the top 5 highest charges)

--11) Average Charges by Region 
SELECT region, AVG(charges as AVG -- selecting the region and avg charges to show up in the output
FROM healthcare_insurance -- selecting from the table 
GROUP BY region -- group by region so each column of avg charges shows the avg for THAT region
ORDER BY AVG -- ordering default from lowest to highest 

--12) Filtering out only high average charges exceeding $12,000
SELECT region, AVG(charges) AS avg_charge -- selecting theregion and avg charges to display output
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
GROUP BY region -- grouping by the region so that each region is a separate column
HAVING AVG(charges) > 12000 -- HAVING filters groups after the grouping, WHERE filters rows before grouping

--13) Filtering out by all females with more than 2 children
SELECT age, sex, children, charges
FROM healthcare_insurance
WHERE sex = 'female' AND children > 2
ORDER BY charges ASC;

--14) Charges based on # of children 
SELECT children, AVG(charges) AS average_charges -- selecting the children column and average charges
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
GROUP BY children -- grouping by children for the results 0 1 2 3 4 children
ORDER BY children ASC; -- ordering from highest to lowest charges

---USING SUBQUERIES more advanced 
--15) Filter out people paying less than the average
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
WHERE charges < (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM healthcare_insurance) - subquery to select the charges less than the selected avg
ORDER BY charges DESC
LIMIT 45;

--16)Filter out people paying more than the average charge
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
WHERE charges > (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM healthcare_insurance) - subquery to select the charges less than the selected avg
ORDER BY charges DESC
LIMIT 45;

--17) Show smokers who pay more than the avg charges
SELECT smoker, COUNT(*) AS count_above_avg -- selecting if they are a smoker or not and counting them
FROM healthcare_insurance -- from the table
WHERE charges > (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM healthcare_insurance) --subquery to calc avg charges
GROUP BY smoker; -- grouping by if they are a smoker or not
